# toolset/

The sources of the programs the wasm shell (skein's `kernel-zig/src/shell.zig`) runs: brush + uutils
coreutils, the toolset of issue #13 (search/edit/structured-data
commands beyond coreutils, each a command name in the shell program's
`modules`, `etc/app.json`), git (issue
#2, also in `modules`), and the script runtimes of issue #25
(`qjs`/`node`, `python`/`python3`; see "Script runtimes" below). All WASI
preview1 modules (`wasm32-wasip1`), built with Rust 1.98.1 (git and qjs: C,
wasi-sdk 34; python: a pinned upstream build) and stripped of symbols.
`scripts/build-toolset.sh` rebuilds all of them into `bin/` (the stdlib zip into `lib/`) from the pinned
sources plus `patches/`, byte-identically on the same machine in the same checkout
layout (paths of the build machine and even line numbers within a patched
file appear in panic-location strings baked into the binary, so a
different machine, or a differently-named `.build/` checkout dir, gets
other bytes — verified the hard way while pinning `sed.wasm`, see the
`tools` branch history).

## Why patched builds and not the releases

- **brush** publishes no WASI artifact (its CI builds `wasm32-wasip2` and
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and tests the former under wasmtime with pipes,
  external commands and command substitution skipped). Upstream under WASI
  runs builtins only: `std::process::Command::spawn` and `std::io::pipe` are
  unsupported there, host env vars are not imported, and `test -x`/PATH
  lookup treat every path as an existing executable.
- **uutils** does publish `coreutils-0.12.0-wasm32-wasip1.tar.gz` (10.4 MB),
  and it runs here unchanged except for one thing: wasi-libc starts every
  program with cwd `/`, and there is no way to hand a child a working
  directory. The one-line patch makes the multicall binary `chdir($PWD)` at
  startup.

## brush.patch

All changes are `#[cfg(target_os = "wasi")]`; native builds are unaffected.

- `sys/wasm/skein.rs` (new): imports from the `skein` module —
  `cmd_exists(name) -> 0|1`, `pipe(*fds) -> errno`,
  `spawn(req, len, stdin_fd, stdout_fd, stderr_fd, *code) -> errno` where
  `req` is NUL-separated `program, cwd, argc, argv…, envc, KEY=VAL…`.
- `commands.rs`: external commands go to `skein.spawn` with the child's stdio
  as fds of this instance; the host runs the child to completion and the
  command completes with its exit code. Builtins in pipeline subshells run
  inline instead of on a (nonexistent) blocking thread. Command substitution
  runs the subshell to completion into a host pipe, then drains it.
  Stdio→`std::process::Stdio` conversion is skipped (no `dup` in WASI).
- `interp.rs`, `sys.rs`: `std::io::pipe()` → `sys::anon_pipe()` (host pipe).
- `shell/fs.rs`, `commands.rs`: a name not found on `$PATH` resolves to itself
  when the host has a program by that name (so `type`, `command -v` work).
- `sys/stubs/env.rs`: inherit the environment (`std::env::vars()`).
- `sys/wasm/fs.rs`: readable/writable/executable = exists.
- `brush-shell/src/main.rs`: `chdir($PWD)` at startup.

Still unsupported under this patch: process substitution `<(…)`/`>(…)`,
coprocesses, background jobs `&` that must run concurrently.

## The toolset (issue #13)

### Inventory: what `feat_wasm` coreutils already has

`coreutils --list` under `feat_wasm` (79 names): `arch b2sum base32 base64
basename basenc cat cksum comm cp csplit cut date dd dir dircolors dirname
echo expand expr factor false fmt fold head hostid join link ln ls md5sum
mkdir mktemp mv nice nl nproc numfmt od paste pathchk pr printenv printf ptx
pwd readlink realpath rm rmdir seq sha1sum sha224sum sha256sum sha384sum
sha512sum shred shuf sleep sort split sum tail tee test touch tr true
truncate tsort tty uname unexpand uniq unlink vdir wc yes`.

Against the issue's list, already covered: `tr`, `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`,
`tee`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `cat`, `printf`/`echo`, `base64`,
`sha256sum`/`md5sum` (plus sha1/224/384/512, b2sum), `paste`, `join`,
`comm`, `fold`, `basename`/`dirname`/`realpath`. **Not** in `feat_wasm`
despite being in full coreutils: `stat`, `du`, `env`, `chmod`/`chown` —
these need filesystem-mode support (`skein.chmod`, the "File modes" item
in issue #13, explicitly out of scope here) and aren't re-enabled by this
change. `file` and `column` were never coreutils (separate GNU/util-linux
projects); see "not attempted" below for `file`. Missing and built here:
`grep`, `find`, `xargs`, `which`, `sed`, `awk`, `diff`/`cmp`, `jq`, `tree`.

### The new modules

- **find, xargs** — uutils/findutils. `find` builds unpatched (needs a
  WASI C toolchain for its `onig` dependency — see "wasi-sdk" below —
  but no source changes). `xargs` needed a real patch: it spawns children
  with `std::process::Command`, which traps under WASI preview1
  ("operation not supported on this platform") the same way brush's did
  before its own patch. `patches/findutils.patch` adds `src/skein.rs`
  (a `skein.spawn` binding, the same wire format as brush's
  `sys/wasm/skein.rs`) and switches `xargs`'s command execution to it
  under `#[cfg(target_os = "wasi")]`; the native code path is untouched.
  Tested: `find . -name '*.go'`, `find . -name '*.go' | xargs wc -l`,
  `xargs -n1`, `xargs -I{}` (multiple invocations per line).
- **diff, cmp** — uutils/diffutils, one multicall binary (like coreutils'
  own) dispatching on argv[0]/binary name, registered under both names
  (same CID). `patches/diffutils.patch`: `cmp.rs` used
  `std::os::unix::fs::MetadataExt` unconditionally for an optimization
  (skip comparing when stdout is `/dev/null`) and `.size()` for file
  sizes; WASI's equivalent (`std::os::wasi::fs::MetadataExt`) exists but
  is nightly-only (`wasi_ext`, rust-lang/rust#71213) on stable 1.98.1, so
  the patch drops the `/dev/null` fast path under wasi (behavior is
  unaffected beyond that one optimization) and uses the portable
  `Metadata::len()` for sizes.
- **jq** — 01mf02/jaq (a jq clone), built `-p jaq --no-default-features`
  (drops the `mimalloc` allocator; `jaq-all`'s own defaults, formats +
  std-all, stay on — so `--from yaml`/`--to yaml` etc. work). Unpatched
  build still fails: `rustyline` (for the `repl` filter builtin, callable
  from inside a jq program) is a required, not optional, dependency, and
  pulls in `fd-lock` via its `with-file-history` feature, which does not
  build for wasm32-wasip1 at all (`sys::AsOpenFile`/`RwLockWriteGuard` not
  found — no `wasi` backend in that crate version). `patches/jaq.patch`
  moves `rustyline`/`dirs` into
  `[target.'cfg(not(target_os = "wasi"))'.dependencies]` and stubs
  `repl()`'s implementation under wasi to return an error ("not available
  (no terminal under the skein WASI host)") instead of silently doing
  nothing — WASI has no termios/ioctl, so there is no real terminal to
  back a REPL either way, same as the skein shell itself.
- **which** — no Rust `which` CLI exists on crates.io, only a library
  (`which`). First-party, `toolset/tools/which` (~50 lines): checks `$PATH`
  entries as files first (`std::env::split_paths` is unimplemented under
  wasm32-wasip1 — "unsupported" panic — so `PATH` is split on `:` by
  hand), then falls back to the host's `skein.cmd_exists` import (the
  same one brush uses to resolve builtins/coreutils/other extra modules
  that are never files in the tree) and prints the bare name — matching
  how brush itself resolves a name not on `$PATH` (see `brush.patch`
  above). Supports `-a`/`--all`.
- **grep** — no GNU-grep-flag-compatible CLI exists in Rust (ripgrep is
  the closest but explicitly disclaims GNU/POSIX flag compatibility:
  different defaults, no `-E`, always-recursive). First-party,
  `toolset/tools/grep`, built directly on the libraries ripgrep itself is
  built from (`grep-matcher`, `grep-regex`, `grep-searcher`, all pure
  Rust). Covers `-r -R -n -i -E -l -v -c -H -h -o -e`, multiple files,
  stdin, and a plain single-threaded deterministic recursive walk (no
  `ignore::WalkParallel`; sorted, since the skein host needs deterministic
  output). Memory maps are never used (`grep-searcher`'s
  `MmapChoice::never()` is already its default — `memmap2` is a
  dependency but is a no-op/errors under WASI at runtime, so this
  matters). **Known gap**: `-E` is accepted but has no effect — patterns
  are always parsed in `grep-regex`'s own syntax (close to POSIX ERE /
  Rust `regex` syntax), never true POSIX BRE (where `( ) { } + ? |` are
  literal unless backslash-escaped). Only affects patterns that lean on
  that BRE/ERE distinction; literal-word searches (`grep -rn TODO`) and
  already-ERE-style patterns behave identically either way.
- **sed** — uutils/sed 0.2.0, unpatched build compiles clean, but has a
  real bug reproducible outside skein/wasm entirely (checked with a
  native build, no patch): `-i`'s clap `Arg` is `num_args(0..=1)` with a
  `default_missing_value`, and clap's optional-value handling for that
  combination swallows the *next* argv entry as the backup suffix even
  though GNU sed only ever takes an attached suffix (`-i.bak`). So
  `sed -i 's/x/y/' f` — overwhelmingly the most common form, and the
  one issue #13 asks to test — treated `'s/x/y/'` as the suffix and `f`
  as the script, and failed. `patches/sed.patch` adds
  `.require_equals(true)`, which fixes the common bare-`-i` case at the
  cost of GNU's attached-without-`=` short form: a backup suffix now
  needs `-i=.bak` (or `--in-place=.bak`) instead of `-i.bak`. Tested:
  `sed -i 's/x/y/'`, `sed -n '2,4p'`, multiple `-e`, `--in-place`.
- **awk** — quinnjr/rawk (crate `awk-rs`) v0.2.0, unpatched; minimal deps
  (`regex`, `thiserror`) build clean. The only other Rust awk
  implementations (`frawk`, its `zawk` fork, `awkrs`) hard-depend on a
  `cranelift`-JIT or similar exec-page-needing backend and cannot run
  under WASI at all — not a build failure, a fundamental incompatibility
  (no interpreter fallback). Tested: field splitting (`$1`/`$2`), `-F`,
  `BEGIN`/`END` blocks, multi-line input over a pipe.
- **tree** — peteretelej/tree (crate `rust_tree`) v1.3.0, unpatched.

### wasi-sdk

findutils' `onig` dependency (Oniguruma, the regex engine behind `-regex`/
`-iregex`/`-name`) is a C library compiled via the `cc`/`onig_sys` build
script; the Rust `wasm32-wasip1` target's bundled wasi-libc is not a C
*compiler*, so `cc` has nothing to compile C with and fails
(`fatal error: 'stdlib.h' file not found`). `scripts/build-toolset.sh` fetches
[wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk) 34.0 into
`.build/wasi-sdk/` (once; ~190 MB, cached after) and points `CC_wasm32_wasip1`/
`CFLAGS_wasm32_wasip1` at its clang + sysroot, only for the findutils step.

### Not attempted

- **`tar`, `gzip`/`gunzip`, `zip`/`unzip`** — no Rust project publishes a
  GNU-tar- or gzip-flag-compatible CLI (only libraries: `tar`, `flate2`,
  the `zip` crate); the closest all-in-one CLI, `ouch`, hard-depends on
  `rayon` (real threads, unlikely to run under WASI preview1) and has its
  own flag syntax regardless. The issue's own phrasing ("if a Rust port
  builds") treats these as opportunistic, unlike `which`/`grep` which it
  asks for outright — building bespoke wrapper CLIs for three formats was
  out of scope for this pass; flagging honestly rather than shipping a
  half-compatible wrapper.
- **`xxd`/`hexdump`** — no xxd-flag-compatible Rust CLI exists (`hexyl` is
  a real, maintained hex *viewer* but a different output format, no `-r`
  reverse mode; `xxd-rs` is stale, pre-1.0 deps). `od` (already in
  `feat_wasm`, e.g. `od -A x -t x1z`) covers the practical need already,
  so this was not pursued further.
- **`yq`** — no standalone pure-Rust `yq` CLI exists (the closest,
  `clux/lq`, literally shells out to a `jq` binary — impossible for us,
  no subprocess). Not a gap in practice: jaq's own format flags cover it —
  `jq --from yaml <filter> file.yaml` (or `--to yaml`) — since `jq.wasm`
  is already built with jaq-all's `formats` feature on. No separate `yq`
  command is registered (registering one under a different argv0 without
  it defaulting to YAML would be a false advertisement of `yq`'s actual
  ergonomics).

## git (issue #2)

Real git — the C source of release 2.55.0, not a reimplementation — built
for `wasm32-wasip1` with wasi-sdk 34's clang: one binary with every builtin
(no dashed commands, no scripts). gitoxide was not needed. Its
`.git/objects` is the Zig kernel's synthetic object directory (docs/VM.md,
"The synthetic object directory"): loose objects are the store's git-raw
records, nothing is stored twice. `scripts/build-toolset.sh` fetches the git
and zlib release tarballs (checked by sha256), applies `patches/git.patch`,
copies `git/config.mak` in and builds. The result is byte-identical to the
committed file, also from a differently-named build directory
(`-ffile-prefix-map`, `-g0` and `--strip-all` leave no build path in it).

Verified in the VM (`kernel-zig/equiv/git.ts`, on the Zig kernel): `init
add rm mv status diff commit log show branch checkout reset restore merge`
(a true merge with a merge commit, and a conflict with markers and
`--abort`) and `tag` (lightweight and annotated), plus `describe`,
`cat-file`, `ls-files`, `ls-tree`, `fsck` and `count-objects`. Author and
committer come from `$HOME/.gitconfig` (`HOME=/` in the shell), the repo's
config or `GIT_AUTHOR_*`/`GIT_COMMITTER_*`, the same way git reads them
anywhere. Dates come from `clock_time_get`, which the kernel answers with
the run's attested time. So a commit depends only on its inputs, and a
replay gives the same id.

### What is built out (config.mak)

`NO_RUST` (2.55's optional Rust parts), `NO_OPENSSL` (git's own SHA-1DC
and SHA-256), `NO_CURL`, `NO_EXPAT`, `NO_PERL`, `NO_PYTHON`, `NO_TCLTK`,
`NO_GETTEXT`, `NO_ICONV`, `NO_PTHREADS`, `NO_MMAP` (objects are read into
memory), `NO_UNIX_SOCKETS`, `NO_IPV6`, `NO_REGEX` (git's bundled regex),
`NO_TRUSTABLE_FILEMODE` (`core.filemode=false`: the tree keeps only the
executable bit, and WASI cannot set it), `NO_SYMLINK_HEAD`, `NO_NSEC`,
`NO_SETITIMER` (no progress timer), `NO_FSMONITOR`,
`SKIP_DASHED_BUILT_INS`; `CSPRNG_METHOD=getentropy`; `prefix=/usr` (so
`/etc/gitconfig` is read from the tree if present); `template_dir` empty.

### The compat layer (`git/`)

wasi-libc leaves the process, user, signal, terminal and socket calls
undeclared. `git/wasi-compat.h` (force-included) declares them and
`git/compat.c` defines them. `git/include/` has the headers wasi-libc
lacks (`pwd.h`, `grp.h`, `netdb.h`, `syslog.h`, `termios.h`, `sys/wait.h`).

- **Child processes** go through the host, the same way brush and xargs
  run theirs: `pipe()` is `skein.pipe`, and `start_command` (patched, below)
  hands the request to `skein.spawn`, which runs the program to completion
  with its stdio bound to this process's fds; `waitpid()` reports the exit
  status. `git` spawning `git` works (merge's `stash create`, gc's
  `pack-refs`), and so do `sh` commands (`/bin/sh` maps to the shell's
  `sh`). When git feeds a child through a pipe, the child runs when git
  waits for it, after git has written and closed its end. A child that git
  feeds and reads at the same time needs two processes at once (e.g.
  repack's `pack-objects`), so it fails with ENOSYS. `fork()`/`exec*()`
  themselves fail with ENOSYS, and so does `start_async` (fork under
  `NO_PTHREADS`); none of the verbs above use it.
- **Working directory**: wasi-libc starts in `/`; a constructor calls
  `chdir($PWD)`, as coreutils and brush are patched to.
- **Users**: uid/gid 0, which is what wasi-libc's `stat` reports for every
  file, so `safe.directory` ownership checks pass. `getpw*`/`getgr*` find
  nothing, so the identity must come from config or the environment
  (otherwise git's own "please tell me who you are" error).
- **chmod/fchmod** succeed and change nothing (wasi-libc's fail with ENOSYS,
  which git treats as fatal when it rewrites config); `umask` is 022.
- **Signals**: masks and `sigaction` are no-ops over wasi-libc's emulated
  `signal()`; `kill` fails (ESRCH), `alarm` does nothing.
- **Temporary files**: `mkstemp`/`mkdtemp` (missing from wasi-libc) name
  files from `getentropy()`, which under skein is the run's deterministic
  random stream (`random_get`), so temporary names replay too. They never
  persist.
- **Terminals, network**: `isatty` is false in the shell, so no pager
  starts and `merge` opens no editor. `getpass`/`tcgetattr` fail. Every
  socket and resolver call fails; remotes (`push`/`pull`/`fetch`/`clone`)
  are out of scope.

### git.patch

- `run-command.c`: under `__wasi__`, `start_command` spawns through
  `skein_spawn` (shaped like the Windows branch: stdio fds,
  `prepare_git_cmd`/`prepare_shell_cmd`, then the pid).
  `run_auto_maintenance` does nothing under `__wasi__`: no automatic
  `gc`/`repack`/`maintenance` after commit or merge, so git never decides
  to pack.
- `read-cache.c`: under `__wasi__` every index entry counts as racy, so it
  is compared by content. The tree records no times: every file and the
  index stat as the epoch, and inode numbers follow load order. So stat
  data cannot tell an edit that keeps the size from no edit (`git commit
  -a` missed such edits). The cost is re-hashing tracked files on each
  command, which is fine at agent-repo sizes.
- `setup.c`: an empty `template_dir` means no templates, with no "templates
  not found" warning on every `init`. No hooks are installed, so none run.

### Not supported

- **Packs.** Loose objects only. The kernel refuses new files in
  `.git/objects/pack` (EPERM), so `git gc` and `git repack` fail there
  ("Unable to create temporary file … Operation not permitted") and write
  nothing; `count-objects` reports `packs: 0`. A pack would hold every
  object a second time, as a blob.
- **The editor**: `commit`/`tag -a` without `-m`/`-F` try to start `vi`,
  which does not exist. (`GIT_EDITOR` naming a shell script in the tree
  should work; untested.) **Pager**: never started (no tty).
- `rebase`, `cherry-pick`, `revert`, `am` and `stash` as a verb were not

## Script runtimes (issue #25)

Skill scripts that use only files and stdio run unmodified: `python3 x.py`,
`node x.js`, `qjs x.mjs`, or `./x` for a `#!` script whose interpreter
(its basename, through `/usr/bin/env`, skipping `env -S`) is one of the
shell's extra programs; any other `#!` still runs under brush. Nothing in
either runtime reaches a network, a process or a wall clock: every clock
read is the runtime's `clock_time_get` (fixed outside a thread, the log
entry's time inside one) and every random byte is the runtime's
`random_get` stream. `src/runtime/scripts.test.ts` checks both. Outside a
thread (`runShell` given no `clock` and no `sleep`), a sleep now moves the
run's virtual clock to its deadline instead of returning with time
unchanged: QuickJS's timers loop until the monotonic clock reaches their
deadline, and with a clock that never moved `setTimeout` spun forever.
Inside a thread the scheduler supplies both, as before.

### qjs / node — QuickJS-ng

Built from source with wasi-sdk's `wasi-sdk-p1.cmake` (`qjs_exe`, Release,
`-DSKEIN_PRELUDE`), stripped with wasi-sdk's `llvm-strip`. ES2023 modules
and scripts (autodetected; `.mjs` is a module), plus QuickJS's own
`qjs:std` / `qjs:os` / `qjs:bjson` modules (`--std` makes them globals).
No TypeScript: a `.ts` file is not stripped of its types.

`patches/quickjs.patch` (all under `#ifdef SKEIN_PRELUDE`):
- `qjs.c` evaluates the modules of `tools/qjs/` (compiled in as C strings
  by `tools/qjs/gen-prelude.mjs`) before the script: `prelude.js` always —
  `console.log/info/debug` on stdout, `console.error/warn/trace` on stderr,
  with a Node-like value formatter and `%s %d %i %f %j %o %O` (upstream has
  only `console.log`, printing objects as `[object Object]`); and, when
  argv[0] is `node`, `node.js` plus the named modules `fs`, `fs/promises`,
  `path`, `process`, `buffer` (bare and `node:`-prefixed). As `node` the
  exit status is `process.exitCode` once the event loop drains.
- `quickjs.c` seeds `Math.random` from `getentropy` (the runtime's
  `random_get`) instead of the clock.

What `node` is — a shim, not Node.js:

| available | not available |
|---|---|
| `process.argv` (`["node", <abs script>, …args]`), `argv0`, `env`, `exit()`, `exitCode`, `cwd()`, `chdir()`, `platform` (`"wasi"`), `arch`, `stdout.write`, `stderr.write`, `nextTick`, `versions.quickjs` | `process.version`, `hrtime`, `memoryUsage`, `on('exit')` (a no-op), `stdin` as a stream (read it with `fs.readFileSync(0)`) |
| `fs` sync: `readFileSync` (path or fd 0), `writeFileSync`/`appendFileSync` (path or fd 1/2), `existsSync`, `accessSync`, `statSync`/`lstatSync` (`isFile`/`isDirectory`/`isSymbolicLink`, `size`), `readdirSync` (`withFileTypes` too), `mkdirSync` (`recursive`), `rmSync`, `rmdirSync`, `unlinkSync`, `renameSync`, `copyFileSync`, `realpathSync`, `readlinkSync`, `symlinkSync`; `fs/promises` and `fs.promises`: the same, resolved | streams (`createReadStream`…), callback-style `fs.readFile(p, cb)`, `watch`, `chmod`, file descriptors (`openSync`…) |
| `path` (POSIX): `join`, `resolve`, `normalize`, `dirname`, `basename`, `extname`, `relative`, `isAbsolute`, `parse`, `format`, `sep`, `delimiter` | `path.win32` |
| `Buffer`: a `Uint8Array` with `toString(enc)`, `from`, `alloc`, `concat`, `isBuffer`, `byteLength`, `equals`; utf8, hex, base64, latin1/binary, ascii | the rest of Buffer's API (`readUInt32LE`, `write`…) |
| `require` of those modules and of relative `.js`/`.cjs`/`.json` files; `module`, `exports`, `__filename`, `__dirname`, `global` | npm packages / `node_modules` resolution; `child_process`, `http`/`https`/`net`/`dns`, `fetch`, `crypto`, `os`, `util`, `events`, `stream`, `zlib`, `worker_threads`, `url`, … — `require` throws `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` naming the module; an `import` fails to load it |
| `setTimeout`/`clearTimeout`/`setInterval`/`clearInterval`/`setImmediate` (global, over QuickJS's `qjs:os` timers; the waits are the runtime's sleeps), `queueMicrotask`, `atob`/`btoa` | `URL`, `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder`, `structuredClone`, `AbortController`, `performance` |

### python / python3 — CPython 3.14.7

Not built here: the WASI build CPython's own WASI maintainer publishes
(brettcannon/cpython-wasi-build, wasi-sdk 24), pinned by version and by the
SHA-256 of the release zip, then stripped of DWARF (30.5 → 7.6 MB).
Building CPython ourselves would add a CPython checkout, its `Tools/wasm`
driver and a native build Python for no functional gain today.

The stdlib is `lib/python314.zip`: `lib/python3.14` of the same release,
every `.py` file, packed **stored** (the build has no `zlib`, so
`zipimport` could not inflate) with fixed timestamps, sorted. It is a raw
block like the modules (the install sends it; the shell program's
`support` names it). The shell mounts it read-only
for python processes only (`support.python` in `etc/app.json`, a second WASI preopen) at
`/opt/skein/python/lib/python314.zip`, with `PYTHONHOME=/opt/skein/python`
and `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` as environment defaults (the caller's env
wins). The mount is not in the tree, never committed, and other programs
do not see it; writes to it fail with EROFS. The tree's own `/usr/local`
is untouched, so pure-Python dependencies can live in the tree (next to a
script, or on `PYTHONPATH`).

Determinism, verified (`scripts.test.ts`): `time.time()`,
`time.monotonic()`, `datetime.now()` read `clock_time_get` → the runtime's
clock; `random` seeds from `os.urandom` → `random_get`; the `str` hash seed
(`hash()`, set iteration order) and `uuid.uuid4()` too — same `seed`, same
values; another seed, others. `time.sleep` is the runtime's sleep.

Not available: `zlib` (so `gzip`, `zipfile` deflate, `tarfile.gz`),
`_ssl`/`ssl`, sockets (`socket`, `urllib.request`, `http.client` fail at
`getaddrinfo`), `subprocess`/`os.system` (`ENOTSUP`), threads
(`RuntimeError: can't start new thread`), `sqlite3`, `ctypes`, `_lzma`,
`_bz2`, pip / third-party packages (none installed; pure-Python ones can be
put in the tree). Imports compile from source every run (no `.pyc` in the
zip, and none written): start-up is about 0.3 s, importing json/argparse/
re/pathlib/csv/datetime/dataclasses/hashlib about 0.6 s, on the dev
machine.

Size options if 19 MB matters: drop test/IDE-only packages from the zip
(`_pyrepl`, `pydoc_data`, `turtle` — about 1.2 MB; the release already
leaves out `test`, `idlelib`, `tkinter`, `ensurepip`); add `.pyc` (faster imports, roughly
doubles the zip) or ship `.pyc` only (no source in tracebacks); or build
CPython ourselves with zlib and a deflated zip (~2.4 MB).

## Where the modules live

Here: `bin/*.wasm` and `lib/python314.zip` are committed, and the manifest
(`etc/app.json`) names each as a file of the app's tree. The install sends
each as a raw block and writes the shell's program record over their CIDs
(skein's docs/APPS.md, "A shell program"). A rebuild here
(`scripts/build-toolset.sh`) rewrites them in place; commit them with the
change that made them, and tag a new version of the app.
